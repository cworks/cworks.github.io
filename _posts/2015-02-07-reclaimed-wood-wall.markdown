So funny story.

My sweet wife and I are renovating an older home and we're getting around to the living room. We like to have friends and family over so naturally I want a TV in this room.  Her...not so much (my brain is still not computing that) however she's a sport and decided we could have a TV with one stipulation: That its not the **center** of attention. Me - "Oh of course not honey we'll get a modest 55 inch HDTV (wink wink)".

So how does one not make an HDTV the center of attention?  Well you make a giant decorative wall to mount it to of course!

We found this awesome place in Dallas, [Orr-Reed Wrecking Co.](http://www.orr-reed.com) that has tons of reclaimed wood (and other treasures), great staff and very reasonable prices.  I filled the back of my truck for $75.

The wood was in all shapes and sizes, colors and textures, but all old...old flooring, shiplap and fencing.  I setup my table and chop saws and went to town cutting dimensioned blocks to various lengths and 2 different widths, 1 inch and 1.5 inch.

Before committing to the wall we decided to lay it out in the garage to get a better glimpse of the final product.  We just picked and placed each piece in pretty much a random brick like pattern to achieve what I'm calling the **"wild style"** effect.

Next step was to prep the wall for wood.  I created a backing with 8 x 12 panels (1/2 thick) on the living room wall and lag bolted them to studs.  We started by nailing the first row onto the backing board then glued each row above with Liquid Nails.  All in all the project cost around $200 bucks and took about 10 hours total, including shopping for the wood.  We're extremely please with the results...now on to finding that TV!
