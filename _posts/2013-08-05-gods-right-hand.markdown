Who has heard of the saying “right hand man”?  What does it mean to be a right hand man?  Some examples are: (Captain Kirk, Spock), (Han Solo, Chewbacca), (President Obama and Vice President Biden). The dictionary says "its a person who contributes to the fulfillment of a need or furtherance of an effort or purpose, an invaluable assistant." - Let's study how Jesus fills this role in the Bible.

The writer of Hebrews starts off the letter with a Biblical picture of God’s right hand man (Jesus).  He says *"Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in theses last days he has spoken to us by His Son (God could of kept silent but he spoke!), whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.  He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of His power. After making purifications for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs."*

To sit at ones right hand means a place of authority, its a place of honor, trust and equality, the writer of Hebrews uses this figurative language to describe Jesus' real exaltation.  The right hand of God is a metaphor for our Lord Jesus...let's take a look.

###God's right hand CREATED the heavens

Isaiah 48:13 - *"My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand forth together."*

Fast forward - We know that all things were made through Jesus and without Him not anything was made this was made.  (John 1:3) Jesus created the heavens!  Hebrews which we just looked at says the same thing...(Hebrews 1:2b) *"whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he also created the world."*

###God's right hand SUPPORTS those who depend on him

Psalm 63:8 - *"My soul clings to you; your right hand supports me"*

Fast forward - Jesus supports us saying (Matthew 11:28-30) *"Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."*

###God's right hand SAVES!

Psalm 98:1 - *"Oh sing to the LORD a new song, for he has done marvelous things! His right hand and His holy arm have worked salvation for Him!"*

Fast forward - (Acts 4:12) Says *"there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven by which we must be saved!"*

###God's right hand is POWERFUL

Exodus 15:6 - *"Your right hand, O LORD, glorious in power, your right hand, O Lord shatters the enemy."*

Fast forward - (Luke 21:26b-28) says *"the Son of Man will come in a cloud with POWER and great glory to gather His people from one end of heaven to the other."*

###God's right hand is JUDGE

Psalm 21:8 - *"Your hand will find out all your enemies; your right hand will find out those who hate you."*

Fast Forward - We know that Jesus will return to judge and separate people from one another as a shepherd separates sheep from the goats.  His people will be placed on His right and will inherit the prepared kingdom of heaven and His enemies will be placed on the left and sent into eternal punishment (Matthew 25:31-46).

###God's right hand is JESUS

Psalm 80:14-17 *"Turn again, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine, the stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself...let your hand be on the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!  Then we shall not turn back from you; give us life, and we will call upon your name! Restore us O LORD God of hosts! Let your face shine, that we may be saved!"*

##God's right hand PAINTS A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF JESUS OUR LORD!

If we review God's right hand across the whole Bible we'll see that its figurative language describing a certain characteristic of God from a human point of view, all of which are reflected in Jesus.

The writer of Hebrews again speaks of Jesus in His exalted position by saying *"We should look to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who (now get this) FOR THE JOY that was set before him endured the cross (Jesus was looking forward like the saints in Hebrews 11), despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God"* (Hebrews 12:2).

The greatest love was possible because Jesus was looking forward to being with His Father, our sins are forgiven because Jesus was looking forward to being with His Father so I MUST *seek the things above, where He (Christ) is, seated at the right hand of God, I should set my mind on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth* (para Colossians 3:1-2).  Christ is alive and He is exalted and He is STILL in His high priestly position working for us (Romans 8:34) *"Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.*" - Amen
