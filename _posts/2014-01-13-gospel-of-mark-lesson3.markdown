###Why was Jesus not well received in his hometown?

#### Mark 6:1-6
He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.  And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.”  And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.  And he marveled because of their unbelief.
And he went about among the villages teaching.

Jesus chooses to go to his hometown of Nazareth despite the likely anxiety His family had towards Him and His rising popularity (see: Mark 3:21).  By this time word of Jesus has reached most of Galilee and He has a following including His apostles who accompany Him to Nazareth.

Jesus the perfect Jew made it His purpose to "remember the Sabbath day" (Exodus 20:8a) and so it's no coincidence that we read of Him teaching in the synagogue.  The Jews present that day (including His earthy family) were astonished with His teaching and **if** this event is the same one recorded by Luke (see Luke 4:16-22) where the Lord read the Prophet Isaiah and remarked that "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing" then it is somewhat curious that the Jews ask "Where did this man get these things?"  They were not questioning where He got the material to teach from, no they were surprised by His interpretation of scripture.  The Jews that day could not see beyond the Lord's humanity so much they said "Where did this **man** get these things?"  The Lord's divinity was hidden from those that had known Him since childhood, they only saw a man and not the fullness of God.  Despite only seeing the rabbi Jesus the congregation admits He has uttered wisdom but they seem uncertain of it's origin.  The congregation also recognizes that Jesus has performed mighty works out side of Nazareth (see Mark 6:5) and so they can not reconcile Jesus the man to the One who is capable of performing miracles.

So it seems the grounds for rejecting Jesus as the Christ was not due to lack of evidence of His works or wisdom...no it seems to be based on purely natural prejudices because they know of Jesus' humble origins and can't harmonize this with the exalted level Jesus is now revealing of Himself.

So Jesus "could do no mighty work there...".  Does this mean the Lord's power changed at this moment?  Indeed no!  The Lord Jesus was just as powerful as always.  His mighty miracles were purpose driven and for those that come to Him in faith (Mark 2:5, 4:40, 5:34, 7:29, 10:52).  The "Unbelief" of those in attendance that day prevented both the opportunity and purpose.  Jesus came to save those who believe and come to Him in faith.  And so let us all humbly come before the Lord in faith, come to such a wonderful Savior, a Savior that has a gentle and humble heart!

###In response to the Pharisees’ question about the washing of hands, what did Jesus say about their traditions?

#### Mark 7:1-8
Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands properly, holding to the tradition of the elders, and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches.) And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?” And he said to them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,

“‘This people honors me with their lips,
but their heart is far from me;
in vain do they worship me,
teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’
You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.”

In this account the Pharisees have left Jerusalem and headed north to Galilee, probably to see what Jesus and His following is all about and one of the first observations they make is some of his disciples eat with defiled hands.  This begs the question...what does Mark mean by saying defiled?  Defilement and dirty are two different things.  Defilement meant "common" or "profane" to God, while dirty is a physical condition, defiled is a spiritual condition.  The Pharisees claim that Jesus' disciples are not walking according to Jewish tradition by not purifying themselves by washing their hands before eatings.  After all the disciples had been out healing the sick and around swarms of common people.

Jesus takes the Pharisees to task on this question because there is no law in the Law of Moses that states one must ceremonially cleans their hands before eating.  However the heart of the matter is indeed a matter of the heart, Jesus exposes their hypocrisy and condemns their superficial admiration of God, that they base on human tradition and not the commandments of God.  So they have long sense diverged from God's commandments and forsaken them for the feeble and vain tradition of elders.  God our Savior has given us His word to guide us, we must first hold fast to it and it alone and be careful not to serve Him based on the traditions of men.  We also must honor God with the purification of our heart first and foremost.

###When a Canaanite woman came to Jesus on behalf of her possessed daughter, why did Jesus call her a “dog”?

####Mark 7:24-30
And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden. But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet. Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. And he said to her, “Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.” But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.” And he said to her, “For this statement you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.” And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.

The last location Mark recorded of Jesus was Gennesaret, he and the apostles landed there after a storm blew them south of their target Bethsaida.  From this Jewish region Jesus travels northwest to the Roman port region of Tyre and Sidon and into an unknown house, hoping to remain anonymous yet His fame was known even to this far off region.  It was indeed hard for Jesus to go anywhere without it being noticed and reported.  Upon hearing that Jesus was near a Gentile woman goes to Him to seek a cure for her daughter who is demon possessed.

The exchange between Jesus and the woman is on the surface quite cryptic and logically difficult to follow but the deeper we consider this passage the more meaningful it becomes.  The women is begging Jesus to heal her daughter and the response is "Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs"....huh?  What children?  What bread?  What dog is He talking about?  Before getting to far ahead we have to backtrack and consider who Jesus was and to whom has he been ministering?  Jesus was the perfect Jew and had been ministering to Jews and fulfilling God's prophesy of Him from the scriptures.  Recall what Jesus said (John 4:22-23) "You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him."  It seems that the Lord is offering up a true test of faith to this woman.  He is saying let the Jews be fully ministered to first by His word before its given to the Gentile dogs.  Now if this lady’s response doesn't impress you then it should!  Jesus has kindled this women by essentially calling her a dog...how would she react?  Well she has the perfect response, the one that Jesus was hoping for!  Her humble response is she willing to take whatever crumbs Jesus is willing to give...she believes in Him that much and it's her faith that makes her daughter well.

###From Mark 8:31-10:34, how many times does Jesus predict his death and resurrection?

8:31
And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again.

9:9
And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.

9:19
And he answered them, “O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.”

9:31b
“The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.”

10:32b-34
And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, saying, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles. And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise.”

###What is the significance of the Transfiguration (9:2-13)?

Jesus takes with Him Peter, James and John and head up a high mountain and He was "changed in form" into a radiant divine glory before their eyes.  Along with Jesus' radiant glory Elijah and Moses appear and talk with Jesus.  And we can't forget God who's voice came from out of a cloud to declare that Jesus is His beloved Son and that Peter, James and John were to listen to Him.

The significance is Jesus fulfills all Prophecy, which is represented by the appearance of Elijah and He fulfills the Law perfectly, which is represented by the appearance of Moses to who God gave the Law.  God testifies through this event and His voice that Jesus has all authority in Heaven and Earth!
