####Exodus 3:13-14a

	Then Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me,
	'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"  God said to Moses,
	"I AM WHO I AM."  And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel,
	'I AM has sent me to you'".

There are many gods mentioned in the bible and each of those gods serve specific finite purposes but the God of all serves an eternal purpose for everyone.  This infinite nature is represented in His timeless name: I AM.
