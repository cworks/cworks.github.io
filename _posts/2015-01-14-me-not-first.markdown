####Luke 14:8-10

	When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down
	in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be
	invited by him, and he who invited you both will come and say to you,
	'Give your place to this person,' and then you will begin with shame
	to take the lowest place.  But when you are invited, go and sit in
	the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you,
	'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of
	all who sit at table with you.

I wanna be first in line, have the best service and as the story goes the best seat without regard for much else...**me first**.  Sadly I fall into this trap from time to time but I'm thankful for God's word that corrects me and for His grace to forgive me.
