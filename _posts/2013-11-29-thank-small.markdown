Yesterday was Thanksgiving and we had the pleasure of spending time with my wife's Grandfather (Poppy).  Before lunch I asked him if he was behaving to which he smiled a little and said "I'm minding Momma".  He promptly said to me "I use to work on Bombers" then I mentioned I use to work on fighter jets which lead us into a nice flowing conversation about our work.  During the conversation I asked him about a certain detail he mentioned, to which he paused and had some difficulty remembering, after a brief pause he looks at me and says *"I'm sorry I can't remember but thank you for your interest and for asking."*  We continued our talk but I was frozen by what I just heard, that is the small (yet big) little helping of thanksgiving he gave me.

Poppy may have forgot a mundane detail about airplanes but he remembered something far more important and that is giving someone thanks for something as small as having conversation.  I was (and still am) stuck by the thoughtfulness of this man.  He taught me a lesson in that moment and that is to be thankful even for the smallest things in my everyday ordinary life and for that I'm grateful.
