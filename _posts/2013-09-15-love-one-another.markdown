*"Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.  No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and His love is perfected in us." (1 John 4:11-12)*

On the night before Jesus would die he said to His apostles...

*"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.” (John 13:34-35)*

###Introduction Question: Is this a new commandment?
Is this the first time Christ taught them the principle of love and the importance of abiding in it?  Listen how Jesus answered the Pharisees question about the greatest commandment...

*"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?" And He said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.  This is the great and first commandment.  And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets." (Matthew 22:36-40)*

Notice that Jesus gave them the unsolicited second commandment, how important does He see this?  The Pharisees (like we so often do) forgot a very important command and Jesus gave them what they needed the most...to love their neighbor as theirself.  He is saying plainly the command to love one another has been around since the giving of the Law but they have forgotten it.  God's law says: *"You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD." (Leviticus 19:18)*.  The law goes on to state that God's people are to treat even strangers as they would like to be treated, saying: *"You shall treat the stranger who visits you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God." (Leviticus 19:35-36)*

So we can see clearly that God has taught His people to love one another even before Jesus gave this teaching but the "new commandment" or newness of this command from Jesus is not that we are to love one another, clearly this was taught by God before but the newness is contained in that His disciples (and us) are to love one another **just as Jesus has loved**.  This love wasn't possible to command before because NO SUCH LOVE had ever been exhibited before!  John writes this by saying the new commandment is the old commandment which is true in Christ (1 John 2:7-8)

This new commandment to love as Christ has loved goes deeper than the command for us to love others as ourselves because He loves us more than we love ourselves!

Paul expresses just this thought in his prayer for the Christians at Ephesus saying...that he bows his knees before the Father, *"from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith -  that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpassed knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God" (Ephesians 3:15-19)*

Following God's commandments is a must for Christians but equally important is striving to love one another as Christ has loved us. (1 John 2:3-4, 1 John 2:8-11).  He has fulfilled the Old Law perfectly in love and by doing so has established His authority over it and has issued in the age of grace that all Christians are under...praise God!

##Consider 3 important points about our love for one another

###1. By this (the fact that we love one another) will be how others know that Christ is with us.

While He may be gone in body His living presence is alive in us and to those around us if we keep this important divine commandment.

Not only must individuals strive earnestly to love those around us with Christ like love but Christians that serve together as a local Church must exhibit such a love for one another that it becomes an identifying property of the congregation.

This is the kind of love Paul sees in the Church at Thessalonica - *"Now concerning brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another, for that indeed is what you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to do this more and more, and to aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you, so that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one." (1 Thessalonians 4:9-12)*

###2. Without love, nothing else matters

"If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.  And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.  If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing" (1 Corinthians 13:1-3)

Such a vast array of things can be said about this text but could it not be more clear that God is both concerned about what we do and as seen here why or what is motivating us to do things?  Remember that love is not only commanded by God but is motivated by Him as well *"We love because He first loved us" (1 John 4:19)*, thus we need to be motivated towards selfless love, the love where I realize in my heart the value of every soul in God's creation.  If I don't have this then I've missed the most important and essential ingredient in being a disciple.

Roger Hillis the author of "One Another" from which I'm teaching and using as material in this post, states the hard truth of the matter in plain speak...I'm paraphrasing but he says - I can talk about love, I can attend all services, sing with all my heart, observe the Lord's supper, have much faith, preach sermons, teach Bible classes, be appointed as an elder or deacon but if I don't love my brothers and sisters then I WON'T GO TO HEAVEN...nothing else matters.

###3. Love requires actions, not just words.

*"Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and truth." (1 John 3:18)*

What do we do about the love we claim to have?  It's not enough to say I love you we have to be there for others in tough times and good times.  Our love for one another must be without hypocrisy and from a pure heart, it must be self-sacrificing like the Lord's is.

John writes: *"By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth."* (1 John 3:16-18) - Is not John teaching exactly what he's heard from the Lord?  John was present when Jesus said *"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.  Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends."* (John 15:12-13)

Lay down his life for his friends...Christ literally did just this, this **action** of love.  So how much more should we be **willing to put our life on hold** to help or just spend time with our brothers?

Paul writes in *(Ephesians 4:1b-3)* that we should *"walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of Spirit in the bond of peace."*

**"bearing with one another"** - we must carry and support one another, again do something...verb stuff, it requires that we act upon the love in our hearts for our fellow man.

We must **"speak the truth in love"** so that we can grow up into Christ who is the head of the body and who joins the whole body together.  When we (each part) are working properly in love, the body grows and is built up in love. (paraphrase Ephesians 4:15-16)

###Love as a family
"Finally, all of you be of one mind, having compassion for one another; love as brothers, be tenderhearted, be courteous;[a] 9 not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing." (1 Peter 3:8-9 NKJV)

**"love as brothers"** - In this text the original greek work for love is not what agape which is what we've studied thus far, rather its phileo (Strongs G5361) which means friendship, that is the love between friends.  Friendship is freely chosen but as brothers we are connected and thus regarded as family.  God has blessed our earthly lives with family to enjoy through His Church.  When a church is healthy its truly a little taste of heaven on earth.

**mistreated** - Without a doubt there will be many times that we'll be hurt, mistreated and misunderstood but it's how we react that makes all the difference.  We must not seek to get even but act in love, we must find some way to be a blessing.

###The bottom line
The more we love each other the more we're like our Lord and the more He is glorified.

##Notes
Love recognizes the desire of someone trying to live for God and helps them with this endeavor.  

**Four loves**  
1. storge/affection - Need-love and Gift-love, mother child relationship  
2. phileo/friendship - One of Two loves in NT, seen in OT between David and Jonathan  
3. eros/romance - Being in love  
4. agape/charity - Unconditional love, Second of Two loves in NT  

**love requires action**  
*"If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?"* (James 2:15-16)

**True Love - The Rich Ruler**  
"And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’” And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.” And Jesus, **looking at him, loved him**, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions." (Mark 10:17-22)  

**The importance of Loving one another**  
“You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift." (Matthew 5:21-24)
