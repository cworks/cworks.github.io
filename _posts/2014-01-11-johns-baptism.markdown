###How did John prepare the way for Jesus?

####By calling people out

John prepared the way for Christ in the most remarkable of ways.  John was a voice crying in the wilderness in a time when all the activity was in towns and cities of Roman occupied Judea.  John preached with power from above not in the crowded city streets but in the desolate, rugged countryside where Israel rushed to hear his voice.  They would withdrawal from the world to hear the word of God something that Jesus still calls us to do.  Jesus calls all of us out of our existing dire condition and into a relationship with him.

####Into Holiness

John would also prepare the way by calling Israel into holiness by confessing their sins and being baptized for the forgiveness of sins.  John preached and he baptized those who repented.  This is still how Jesus calls sinners home, by hearing the word preached, repenting and being baptized for the forgiveness of sins and into a forgiven life where we strive to be holy as He is holy.

####Exalting Jesus as Lord

John would also make the Lord's path straight by proclaiming Christ as coming and not only coming but being "mightier than I".  Like all true servants and preachers of Christ, John shifted focus away from himself and to the Lord.  John recognizes his own position in relationship to Jesus and that is he is lower than even a lowly slave, thus showing how highly Christ is exalted in his mind.  This too should still be the attitude of all those seeking to serve the Lord, Christ first and above all things.

###What was the purpose of John's baptism?

John himself proclaimed "I have baptized you with water, be he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."  John called Jews out to the wilderness to "hear" preaching about something that has plagued all of humanity since the beginning...our sinful condition.  John's main purpose was to call people to face the severity of their sin by hearing the message preached and responding.  The response was repentance and water emersion as an act of obedience and righteousness.

###What is the baptism of the Holy Spirit?

The baptism of the Holy Spirit is a higher baptism than John was capable of.  Baptism of the Holy Spirit is a cleaning of the inner part of man...that is the soul and is only possible by God through Jesus Christ.  Paul writes in Romans 5 "...God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."

###What did people immediately recognize about Jesus when he cast out unclean spirits?

Mark 1:27
And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.

A truthful person would recognize His authority.

###What is implied about Jesus when he heals the paralyzed man who is lowered through the roof?

Key phrase...Mark 2:7 "...who can forgive sins but God alone?".

Jesus asked the scribes a simple question...which is harder to say, "your sins are forgiven" or "rise, take up your bed and walk?".  A question that the scribes don’t answer because the answer is obvious.  To say your sins are forgiven is way easier because it can't be proven.  To say rise and walk is much harder because it can be verified by what the man does or doesn't do.  If the man offering forgiveness can do the much harder thing in willing a paralytic to rise and walk then that's evidence he can make good on the easier thing to say, which is your sins are forgiven and if God is the only one who can forgive sins then this implies that the man offering forgivenss (Jesus) is Immanuel (God with us).

###What is blaspemy of the Holy Spirit? (Mark 3:29)

To understand the eternal sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit one has to understand the character of God, especially His goodness, holiness and purity.  God sent forth Jesus and in Him all the fullness of God dwelled bodily, his miracles and expulsions of evil spirits where done to set forth the character of God in Christ Jesus.  To call the Holy Spirit of Christ an evil spirit was to say Christ was sent forth from satan and was operating under evil intentions.  To make such a claim is to call light dark and dark light and one who spoke such a thing is obviously satan or one of his minions who are all cut off from the saving power of God.

It's one thing not to believe in Christ but it's another to say Christ is being driven not from the Holy Spirit of God but from satan.
