####Mark 8:34-37
Jesus called those following Him and taught them saying "whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.  For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel's will save it.  For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?"

Jesus our Savior and Friend makes His great worth known to those who lay aside their will in favor of His will and wouldn't you know that denying our way is a major struggle for us.  I mean...I want it my way (because I'm right)...you just don't understand, I want to do this, I want to do that...hey its my Saturday!

How strong is the King - He did the Father's will and all the while being tempted but never faltering.  Jesus likens this to the rigors of carrying a cross, something that He was doing well before Calvary.  To go my own way in the face of Jesus's way isn't a gain for me at all, I may be dupped into feeling overly proud or important for a moment, I may even amass quite a little kingdom for myself but in doing so I've lost what's eternal!  Was it worth it?  Is it worth it?  I falter too much in these ways, satan wins far too often on my account, that's one of the many reasons I need Jesus and His grace.  Help me Oh God to see your great worth each day and to do the best I can!
