How to make Minion costumes is super way to distract you from that home renovation project that never seems to end.  What you might ask is the secret?  Well it's having a house under reno to perform the Minion making in!

### Things we used
1. One 24 inch beach ball for the short chunky Minion's head    
2. One 20 inch crunch ball for the skinny Minion's head  
3. 6 sheets of white poster board for the bodies  
4. Silver duct tape  
5. Black duct tape  
6. Hot glue (and ban-aids)  
7. Some old towels (used in the body forming process)  
8. Newspaper  
9. Flour for the paper mache  
10. White spray paint for primer  
11. Yellow spray paint
12. Several cans of canned chicken for the eyes
13. Long sleeve yellow t-shirts or white ones with some yellow dye
14. Jean-like material for the Minion overalls
15. Black or brown pipe cleaners for hair
16. Velcro helps for the eyes (but you could glue them on)
17. Some spare foam for head padding
18. White, Black, Yellow and Blue paint
19. Tin foil
20. Denim like material for overalls

### Tools
1. Drill with bit set  
2. 1-inch hole saw bit  
3. Hot glue gun  
4. Tables  
5. Scissors  
6. Utility knife  

### Misc items
1. A stinky wheels off Shih Tzu dog
2. A fat curious weenier dog
3. A nutty wife

### Getting started
First thing is to clear a space to work and if you don't have a space then buy a house to renovate and work in it and if that's not possible buy a Minion costume from Party City (just kidding, its easy and not too messy).  

### Minion forms
Once you have a place to work the next order of business is to make the Minion form (head and body).  To do this we used a 24 inch Texas Ranger beach ball, this seemed like a good choice since we were going to pop it later, sort of a metaphor for the 2013 season.  {% img right /images/minions/IMG_0019_blog.jpg 400 %}  We used this one to form the short stubby Minion's head then wrapped poster board around the ball making a seam in the middle of the sphere and securing all seams with duct tape (duct tape will be your best friend).  We then repeated this process with a 20 inch crunch ball.  *Note* - You probably can save the crunch ball by ensuring the blow-up hole faces down and not up because the top of the head is going to be covered in paper mache.

Once the forms are made the next thing is to start cutting 1 to 2 inch strips of newspaper and mixing up a hearty bowl {% img left /images/minions/IMG_0021_blog.jpg 220 %} of paper mache using plain old flour and water.  Play with the ratio of flour to water until you get a consistency like Muscle Milk (or expired milk with some chunks).  Start covering the form in paper mache from top to bottom.  You will need 3 layers so run each layer in the opposite direction of the one below it.  For example: if you start running the strips from top to bottom then the 2nd layer's strips will be left to right.  

After you're done with that marathon paper mache session place the Minion forms next to a fan and pad the inside with some towels so they keep form while drying overnight.

Alright so that's about all you can do until those puppies dry.  Speaking of puppies check on your Shih Tzu dog and if he's asleep then it's time for bed.  Wash your hands and hit-the-hay, tomorrow is paint night.

### The next day...it's time to paint
Alrighty, its the next day and time to get some color on these Minions.  Clear a spot outside where you can do some spray painting.  After you get setup apply a coat of white primer so the newspaper print will cover up once the yellow is applied.  We tried with no primer but the yellow wasn't enough to cover up the darker areas of newspaper print.  We used Valspar white spray paint primer from Lowes but just plain white spray paint should work too.  {% img left /images/minions/IMG_0007_blog.jpg 220 %}  Let the while paint dry then apply 2 coats of yellow spray paint.  We used 4 cans of yellow Krylon spray paint.  These will need to dry overnight so now would be a good time to start dying some long sleeve white shirts yellow.  {% img right /images/minions/IMG_0016_blog.jpg 240 %}  Now if you can find yellow long sleeve shirts then skip this step but we were not so fortunate and had to make our own.  Walmart sells individual dye packets so we purchased one and used it to dye 2 shirts.

### Finishing touches
Ok now the remaining tasks are all detail work but before we get going on that it's time to pop the beach and crunch balls from the Minion forms.  The head and body should be fully dry; mache and paint so it's a good time to remove them.  Pop them with a knife and slowly pull them out.  

{% img left /images/minions/IMG_0031_blog.jpg 480 %}  Next make the eyes out of the chicken cans and drill an inch in diameter hole somewhere in the bottom of the can.  This will be what you see out of and to help with the placement of the hole we painted the inside bottom of the cans like an eye then drilled out the iris.  

Minions need hair so braid some pipe cleaners and drill some small holes in the head to put them through.  On the underside tape or glue the excess pipe cleaners to the head so they stay put.

The last few things are painting the mouths, glueing on the denim like material for the overalls and eyes then cutting holes so your arms hang out.  Once that's it put those bad boys on and run around the yard!
