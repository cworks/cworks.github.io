Motivational Quote:
"Marcus Luttrell - I died upon that mountain, a part of me up there is dead, there is part of me that lives because of my brothers - Operation Red Wings."

We are suppose to live because of each other.

Do we start estranged from brethren?
------------------------------------
Unfortunately we will disappoint and be disappointed, usually this happens at the same time.

###(Mark 14:66-72) - Peter emphatically denies Jesus.

Peter and Jesus were brothers in the spiritual sense.

* There are times when we don't believe or trust our brethren (Matthew 16:21).  
* Peter's problem is our problem, there are times when we don't love our brother.  
* If Peter believed Jesus he would have been at His side, testifying for Him, likewise if we believed our brethren we'd be at each others side.

Conflict between brethren produces no winner.  Paul encourages us to "live in harmony in the Lord" (Phil 4:2) and to have the same mind and same love (Phil 2:2).

###Remember

* We labor together (cf: Phil 4:3) "Help these women (Euodia, Syntyche) who have labored side-by-side with me in the gospel."
* Who are we striving against? (1 Peter 5:8-9) "Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.  Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of sufferings are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world."
* Our goal is peace (Romans 12:17-18) "Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all.  If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all."

###Our lifestyle

(1 John 1:6-7) "If we say we have fellowship with Him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.  But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin."

* We share a common fellowship
* We share a common commitment
* We share a common forgiveness

If individually we draw nearer to the Lord then as a matter of course we're drawing nearer to one another, basic geometry principle.  Arc Length = degrees x pie x radius / 180

###(John 21:15-17) - Second chances

Early that morning on the shores of the sea of Tiberias Jesus makes a welcoming fire and breakfast for his disciples.  After they had finished breakfast Jesus makes the first move with Peter, face to face now Jesus asks him the most important question of us all...do you love me?

* Jesus was prepared to believe that the events around his denial were not characteristic of the real Peter.
* OR that the events surrounding His arrest, inquisition, execution and resurrection had changed Peter for the better, that the love Peter *thought* he had was now replaced with the real thing.

How we grow (forgiveness)
-------------------------
Learning to forgive is one of the most difficult tasks the Lord gives, yet it attaches us to Him in a very special way.

* The Bible says that our own forgiveness depends on the attitude of forgiveness we have towards others. (Matt 6:15) "If you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will you Father forgive you trespasses" (Matt 18:35, Parable of unforgiving servant).

The more we understand about how much we need God's forgiveness and how he grants it and how grateful we are to have it THEN the more inclined we will be to forgive and build bridges with our brethren.

When we find a relationship with God through the blood of Jesus we are granted a precious bond with God and His children.

* God forgives because He loves us
* He loves us because we are His children
* We are His children because we've been born again (John 3:3)
        
If we are patterned after God then
        
* We forgive because we love our brethren
* We love our brethren because they are His children
* They are His children because they've been born again
        
Don't count offenses.  Have we counted every thing we've done against God our Father?  How much less should we not count offenses if we're not counting the ones we've done against God?

Things that blow up bridges (James)
-----------------------------------
###Filthiness, wickedness, immoral behavior, anger* also a good story of forgiveness!

(James 1:21) "Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls."

(Ephesians 5:3-5) "But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints. Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."

(Colossians 3:8) "But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth."

Nothing will destroy the precious fellowship we have in Christ like "sin in the camp".

Playing with fire (Proverbs 6:27-28).

Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?
Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?

###Partiality (James 2:1-9)

Showing respect of persons, either through "partiality" or "bigotry" makes us sinners. Having a state of mind where a person strongly and unfairly dislikes other people.

####Nature of our differences
1. Race
2. Nationalities
3. Political ideologies
4. Economic status
5. Lifestyles
6. Secular interests
7. Spiritual maturity
    
Prejudice in one of these areas can destroy relationship and create gaps.

(Galatians 3:27-29) For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.

God revealed Himself to Israel as One who shows no partiality.

(Deuteronomy 10:17) For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe.

Fellowship in Christ is designed to bring us together, not divide us.

*Recall the story of Issac, Jacob and Esau.* also a good story of forgiveness!

###Misuse of speech (James 3:1-12)

Our speech possesses great power to destroy if we're not careful (James 3:5-7)

When we misuse our speech to curse man it reveals the *shallowness* of our praise to God (James 3:9-12)

###Selfishness (James 3:13-16, 4:1)

(James 3:13-16) For where jealousy and selfish ambition exists, there will be disorder and every vile practice.

(James 4:1) What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you?  Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?

The root cause of gap creation is nothing more than plain old selfishness.

###Speaking evil of one another (James 4:11-12)

Here we learn that speaking evil against another is actually speaks evil against God's law. We also set ourselves up as judges when there is really only one Judge.

This does not mean we cannot use righteous judgment (John 7:24) - Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.

(I Corinthians 5:12-13a) Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?  God judges those outside.

We have to check ourselves first because we do not want to be guilty of judging others according to our own standards and bias.

Tools for bridge building (James)
---------------------------------
###Challenges are opportunities (James 1:2-4)

Possessing a positive perspective about difficulties is good for us individually and collectively.

###Pray for wisdom (James 1:5-8)

To be able to maintain bridges and thrive together we need wisdom from God.

###The Proper perspective (James 1:9-11)

We need to maintain the proper perspective about ourselves and others.  Gaps are created by envy and pride.

See ourselves as God sees them, then there will be no room left for pride or envy.

###Be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath (James 1:19-20)

Poor communication and short tempers will quickly destroy a relationship but if we apply these graces then problems can be gracefully overcome.

###Practice pure religion (James 1:22-27)

* Be doers of the word
* Let our actions speak louder than words
* Attending to the needs of others
* Keep ourselves unstained by the world

We must be practitioners.

###Wise and humble conduct (James 3:13, 17-18)

(James 3:17-18) FAVORITE - Wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.  And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

(Galatians 6:1-2) Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

###Pray for one another (James 5:13-16)

* We have to pray for one another, we can't build a bridge without it.
* Its hard to be angry at brothers that we're praying for.
* Its hard not to love those praying for us.
* When we are praying for one another not only is our fellowship with our brethren strengthened but our relationship with God is strengthened as well.

###Bring people back (James 5:19-20)

Like Jesus our Shepard we are responsible for bringing back our brother.

When brethren stray from the faith we lose the benefit of there fellowship with us, restoring them back saves them but blesses us with their renewed fellowship.

Misc Notes
----------

###Ministry of Reconciliation

(Genesis 33:4) But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.

(Matthew 5:24) Leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.

Repair a strained relationship with a brother before worshiping God.  Make quick amends or there's no telling where we'll end up.

(Colossians 3:13) Bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.

(Ephesians 4:32) Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.

(Hebrews 12:14) Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord

(1 Peter 4:8) Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.
