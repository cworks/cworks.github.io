Texas Junior Camp 2014 - Closing devotional, given on 7/19/2014.

### Intro - The value of a Smile

Well we've had a great week together, the Lord has blessed us with rain and cooler temperatures and each other!  I've truly enjoyed the week, words can't express how much encouragement I receive from all of you, this week supercharges the back half of my year and I'm just so grateful we've gotten to spend it together and learn more about our wonderful God.

The theme this year has been "Facing the World, with the Face of God" and I couldn't help but think about our theme as we watched the slide-show last night.  Slide after slide all I saw were BIG smiles from throughout the week and I thought "now that's one way to face the world with the face of God".

Do you know where you learned to smile?  You learned it long ago when you were a baby and you learned it from your parents.  Thats right before you could talk or comprehend words you could smile.  Your parents would "googly goo" you with a smile on their face and you would reflect their face by shining your cute little baby face.

Babies aren't born with the ability to speak or recognize words so they recognize emotions and expressions from their parents and then mirror those looks back.  This gives babies comfort knowing there is someone smiling upon them instead of living in an "unknown" and "unpredictable" new world.  Babies learn at an early age *the value of a smile* and it helps form the basis of their relationship with their parents, through this relationship they are nourished and brought up with love an affirmation.

### The Glad face of God

A shining face is related to gladness and it's the opposite of a downcast or gloomy face.  The glad face of God upon us is like that of a parents upon a child.  God taught His priesthood to share His glad face with the people of God, to pass on His gladness and His affirming look to them.  It is God's will to bless His people, just like its a parents desire to bless their children.  God knows this is exactly what His people need, like a baby needs smiles and looks of affirmation when they are young.  However not everything we do brings God's smiling face upon us, frankly sometimes we stink things up and that smile and approval will turn to a frown and disapproval.  We have to take care of our relationship with God so we live within the light of His smiling face.

The fact that God looks towards us in gladness should mean a lot to us.  The warm smile from someone who loves us is precious, how much more precious is the shining face of our heavenly Father.

God shining His face upon us is remarkable and wonderful, and its a component of the Priestly blessing in Numbers but that blessing runs much deeper than just God's shining face, *it is in some respects the whole of God's will for His people.*

### God's Blessing

(Numbers 6:22-27)

The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the people of Israel: you shall say to them,

The LORD bless you and keep you;
The LORD make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you;
The LORD lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.
	
So shall they put my name upon the people of Israel, and I will bless them.

### (Numbers 6:24) The Lord bless you and keep you

The blessing says "Bless you and keep you", it was God's will for His people to experience in fullness His favor for them He wanted to bless them and for Israelites that was a source of comfort and happiness but the blessing extends beyond good words alone and into *action*.  God is always working and putting into action what is necessary to bless His people, He said "and keep you".  Our God protects and guards us as His own and for the ancient Israelites this meant caring for them in a way they needed in order to survive, by giving them safe passage from Egypt, by providing them food, drink and rest and most importantly His presence.  God's will is to bless and keep and this brings to mind a shepherd caring for His sheep.  Jesus is "the good shepherd.  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them".  We don't serve a god who only speaks, we serve the Living God who *speaks and keeps*!

### (Numbers 6:25) The Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you

We need the Lord's face to shine on us.  It gives us spiritual nutrients and produces growth.  Think about a flower that is cared for, we water it and place it in the sun, it grows and yields seeds that will drop and spread.  If we take a flower and place it in the dark it will die and be unable to produce seeds and thus it can't spread.

It's wonderful to know that God *make* His face to shine upon us.  When we make something we set out with a purpose or vision of what we want to make.  God designed and implemented a way for His grace to shine upon us!  It was his desire to do so!

God's shining face is connected to His grace.  The God of heaven and earth is able to look upon is with favor because He authored and implemented a way for this to be so.  You know we can mess stuff up pretty good and not be very useful for God and His purposes but even so while we were going about fumbling around God stepped in and did something for us that we ourselves could not do, He sent His son in the likeness of Himself to teach, love and lay down His life so everyone could become a child of God and walk in the light of the Father.

### (Numbers 6:26) The Lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.

Countenance is the expression of ones face and it involves taking notice of what someone has done.  When I was little league baseball player I'd stand in the batters box and look down the 3rd base line to get the signs from our coach.  When I looked to get the signs, all my kid brain could see was hand waves going every direction when in reality he ran one hand across the belt which meant I needed to bunt the ball.  My coach was wanting me to sacrifice my at bat to move a runner from first to second but most of the time I would miss the sign and my coach's countenance would fall and look something like:

This look brought on lots of anxiety and fear when I met him in the dugout.  However sometimes in the rare case I actually got the sign and attempted the bunt he would look like:

{% img center /images/maygodsface/countenance2.jpeg %}

Which was comforting because I knew there would be peace in the dugout.

When we're striving to do the best we can for God and making ourselves useful for His purposes, then His face is lifted towards us and this brings about assurance and peace.  If God were to hide His face or look away it would not bring peace at all, in fact it would bring great anxiety and fear!  Being at peace with God is something we want in our lives, it means the whole of our life is good to our Father and we can approach Him and He can use us for His purposes.  *Where there is peace there is no impediment to get in the way of us serving God.*

### God's Blessing is sure and true

The LORD publicly pronounced His blessing through His appointed priest Aaron.   He was *NOT* appointed to bless the nations who were without God but to speak the blessing to the children of Israel.  Likewise God has appointed One above all to bless His people, the great High Priest and Lord Jesus Christ.  Jesus is continually blessing all people everywhere that call upon His name.

### Sacrifice before Blessing

The blessing was a blessing given through God's high priest.  Not just any man could bless the people with these words and it be true.  Only God's high priest was authorized to do so.  Aaron's hands both blessed the people and carried out sacrifices for the people.  The same hands that were stained with blood from sacrifices were the hands that would bless.  Aaron would first offer sacrifices before bestowing the blessing as only he was authorized to do.  Indeed there is no more authentic blessing than one from the priesthood of God.  *There must be sacrifice before blessing.*

God now bestows this blessing through the Lord Jesus who was both God's High Priest and His holy sacrifice who offered Himself without spot and is the one and only Mediator between God and us.  Without Jesus this blessing cannot be bestowed today because it must be sealed with sacrificial blood.

### Intercession

Aaron did not bless the people of his own will.  God set him apart to serve in this way. Likewise Christ did not assume the office Himself but was appointed by God and certified by God to bless us.  These are Words from God! "On this wise you shall bless the children of Israel".  *God's wisdom...not Aaron's*.  The blessing is from God's mind and the blessing is to be continued.  It was not dependent upon the life of one man. Moses was to speak to Aaron and His sons.  The blessing was to continue from generation to generation.

Aaron would cry out for the man of God to Jehovah.  The blessing given to Aaron from God was lifted up to Him for people.  Simply put Aaron would mediate for the Israelites.  "The LORD bless you and keep you".  Likewise the Lord Jesus makes intercession for His people (Heb 7:25, John 17:20-26).  Jesus turns to the Father and petitions for us then He turns to us and bestows blessings.

### Closing thoughts

God knows how we have messed things up, we didn't deserve His shining face but HE considers US worthy because He has created us in His image, there is some part of us that is a part of God!  He wants to restore that godly image in US!  We need God to identify with us, we need to let God know that we need Him and we're thankful for what He's done, that we want to be part of His flock, we want His name to be placed on us.  God has made provisions for His name to be placed on us so we too can walk both in the light and reflect His light to the world around us!
