Why has it taken me 30 years to figure this out?  Random men's restroom tip here...

People everywhere, hear hear - After using the restroom, dispense the desired amount of paper towels **BEFORE** washing your hands, leave it on the paper towel dispenser, wash hands (with soap) then tear the paper towel from the dispenser.  This way you're not touching the nasty dispenser handle with clean hands.

Have a great day
