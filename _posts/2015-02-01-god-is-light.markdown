####Genesis 1:3

	And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.

One thing I know is the more I study the Bible the more I realize I don't know.  The creation account has always given me great appreciation for God's sovereign power but I'm sad to say the **penny never quite dropped** on what this account says about **how much God loves the world**.

The apostle John said:

####1 John 1:5b

	"that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all".

Considering this passage in light of (pun intended) the creation account the **penny finally dropped** and I saw how much God **put into** creation.  He filled creation with light even before the "two great lights" existed, God is the source of all light both physical and spiritual and it's encouraging to know God not only created this world but He **put some of Himself** into it as well.
