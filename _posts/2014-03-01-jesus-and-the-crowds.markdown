And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home.  And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door.

###Mark 6:30-44

Jesus tries to retire to the country side but many people were coming and going such that Jesus and His apostles had no time to eat.  Jesus and His apostles went away in a boat but the crowd followed them around the shore and gathered on the other side.  When Jesus docked on the other side He had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd.  There was a problem of no food so this is where Jesus would feed the crowd by transforming 5 loaves and 2 fish into enough to feed 5000+ and have 12 baskets of leftovers.

###Mark 6:53-56

Jesus calls the crowd to Him and teaches "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.  For whoever would save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it.  For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?  For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."

###Mark 9:14

The crowds were coming to His apostles and the scribes gathered around them and were arguing with His apostles.  Jesus appears and the crowd ran up to Him and He asks what is being argued?

Conclusion
==========
The Lord Jesus was a tireless worker during His earthly ministry.  He lived not for himself but entirely for others, calling everyone to repentance and faith in God.  He loved people but was not a people person, he did not tell people what they wanted to hear yet the people followed Him, some out of curiosity, some with evil intentions and some with faith.  He had compassion for people and His mission was to shepherd them back to His father.

This day and age we have so many other things to follow, Twitter and Facebook are built on the concept of following, people crowding around other people because we (myself included) love to socialize.  We follow people and they follow other people, Jesus is followed by many because He follows only One and does so for the sake of our souls.

*“For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you,leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.”* (1 Peter 2:21-25)
