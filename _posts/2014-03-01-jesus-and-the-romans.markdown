###Mark 7:24-30

The Syrophoenician women residing in Tyre and Sidon (a Roman province) comes to Jesus in faith and asks that her daughter be healed of her demon possession.  Jesus seeing her faith, heals her daughter.

Ok not exactly a Roman but close :)

###Mark 12:13-17

The Pharisees and Herodians seek to trap Jesus into contradicting Roman law (Caesar's Roman tax) or against the Law of Moses by asking Him if its lawful or isn't lawful to pay taxes to Caesar.  Jesus calls for a denarius and ask whose face is on the coin, to which they say Caesar.  Jesus replies to give Caesar the things that are Caesar and to God the things that are God's.

###Mark 15:1-5

The Jews deliver Jesus over to Pilate along with all the accusations they made against Him, most of which was a charge of sedition against Rome.  Jesus made no answer to those accusations and Pilate was amazed.  The silence of Jesus at this moment was louder than any words to Pilate's ears.

###Mark 15:6-15

The Roman prison was full of rebels and freedom fighters against Rome and it's Pilate's tradition to free one prisoner during the feast.  Pilate assumes they would want Jesus released and asks them such but the Jewish leaders stir up the crowd against this notion.  Pilate releases Barabbas and at the Jewish leaders request delivers Him to be crucified.

###Mark 15:16-20

The Roman soldiers take Jesus into Pilate's headquarters and call together a battalion of soldiers (600 men).  They mock, spit and strike Jesus then led Him out to be crucified.  Throughout all this Mark does not record one word from Jesus.

*"He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth."* (Isaiah 53:7)

###Mark 15:21-32

The Romans take Jesus to Golgotha and offer Him wine and myrrh before they nail His body to the cross an offer that Jesus refuses.  The Romans cast lots for the "King of the Jews" garments and placed a sign above His head that read such.  Jesus again remains silent to Roman authorities.

###Mark 15:39

"And when the centurion who stood facing Him, saw that in this way he breathed His last, he said - Truly this man was the Son of God!".

Mark records a Roman soldier standing face to face with Jesus and declares that He *was* the Son of God.  The centurion evidently thought the death of Christ was the end.  The cross had a greater effect on this man who was simply ignorant to Christ than on the Pharisees and Jews who were looking for the Christ.
