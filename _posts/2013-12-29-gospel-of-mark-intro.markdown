###Synoptic Gospels
Matthew, Mark and Luke are referred to as "synoptic" gospels because they can be "seen together" to tell the gospel story from a similar point of view, with similar order and similar wording.  Matthew, Mark and Luke can be set down side-by-side and their common parts viewed together and in relative close order.  Because the synoptic gospels are so similar in content and wording scholars have argued all 3 synoptic gospels are based on a common "hypothetical" account which scholars call "[Q](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_source)" OR 2 of the 3 are based on 1.  Mark is the "1" most scholars agree is both the earliest (preserved) gospel account and the basis for Matthew and Luke.

###John Mark

#### Acts account

The first mention of Mark in scripture is in Acts 12 during the narrative describing Peter's escape from prison by the help from an angel.  After Peter safely reaches the city gates he gathers himself and heads to "the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying." (Acts 12:12).  Shortly after the death of Herod Agrippa I, Paul and Barnabas return to Antioch and take John Mark with them (Acts 12:25) where they would set sail to Cyprus to start their first gospel mission.  Next mention of Mark is a short statement saying that "John (Mark) left them and returned to Jerusalem", Mark left Paul, Barnabas at Perga in Pamphylia, which is one of the farthest points of the first mission.  The biblical account doesn't give details on why Mark left the mission so one can only speculate but we do know that Paul was not so quick to forget Marks's decision when it was time for a second missionary trip.  Barnabas wanted to take Mark but Paul refused since Mark withdrew from the previous work.  Acts 15:39 says "there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they (Paul and Barnabas) separated from each other."  Barnabas would take Mark and set sail for Cyprus and Paul took Silas and headed for Syria strengthening Christians and as far as we know this was the last time Paul and Barnabas would work together.

#### Inspired Writer

Mark was not an apostle and the biblical account does not reveal Mark being in direct contact with Jesus during his ministry so in this respect Mark is similar to Luke who wrote "just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us".  Mark is a man that has been delivered the gospel and a man inspired by God to re-deliver this account in written form.

Thinking back to the Acts account we can see that Mark was the son of Mary a prominent disciple of Jesus.  Mary's house was a well known meeting place for the brethren (Acts 12:12-17) she was also the sister of Barnabas (Col 4:10) and uncle to John Mark.  Mary by all accounts was full of hospitality and associated with the apostles and the early Church.  Mary's house would provide a wonderfully rich environment for John Mark to soak up the good news from the apostles.  Mark would later be selected to assist in the gospel missions of Paul and Barnabas (Acts 12:25, 13:5, 15:37-39) no doubt inspired to do so from his solid belief in the Lord, a belief that was nurtured in his home life.

Mark is also associated later on in his life with Paul again, it seems that Paul and Mark are reconciled from Mark leaving the first mission work.  In fact Paul says that Mark has been "a great comfort to me" (Col 4:11) and later on during Paul's second imprisonment he writes to Timothy asking him to bring Mark to Rome because "he is very useful to me for ministry".  Mark is one man that Paul wants to see before he dies.

Early Church history also has Mark being an interpreter of Peter, Papias an elder of the Church in Hierapolis wrote that Mark was a recorder of Peter and wrote accurately but not in same order that Peter remembered the things said or done by the Lord.  Peter actually referred to Mark as his "son" (1 Peter 5:13) and this shows that Mark was with Peter when 1 Peter was written.

When we step back and consider Mark and Mark's environment there can be no doubt that Mark wrote as an inspired man of God.  His access to true sources of information on the Lord coupled with direct aid of the Holy Spirit Mark was able to be a guardian of truth and has handed mankind the earliest preserved God breathed gospel story.  Indeed Mark possessed authority to write this account, for it's hard to rationalize that an uninspired writer would have had better opportunities to inform himself and to actually take advantage of those opportunities to accurately write of events which he had not been an eye-witness.  God gave Mark the opportunities and inspired him to write a wonderful account of the Lord Jesus.
