####Acts 2:46-47

	And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in
	their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,
	praising God and having favor with all the people.  And the Lord
	added to their number day by day those who were being saved.

I enjoy the warmth felt when I read about the young church family in Jerusalem but even more I love having experienced this same warmth with my church family.  It serves as a reminder that such things aren't accomplished by only attending worship on the first day of the week but rather by a continual commitment to each other and the Lord.
