####Matthew 18:21-22

	Then Peter came up and said to him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?”  Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.

I'd say forgiving someone seven times is an excellent example of mercy and grace but the Author of mercy and grace Himself reminds us to be more like Him than Peter.  The Father whose forgiveness is extended to us not once or twice but to unimaginable lengths through the sacrifice of His son, teaches us that our forgiveness of others has no bound.
